MindMate

In our day-to-day stressed routine, we forget to treat our mind and this follows to chronic mental health disorders like depression. Many of the times due to people’s perspective and a shy nature they refrain from consulting a psychologist or a counsellor.Our application will work as your mental health companion. It can help you if 
you feel unwell by asking about your symptoms so you can check for any medical and psychological conditions associated with them. The chatbot aims to help those who have issues with their mental health. It is an intermediator which will unobtrusively inform doctor after a particular threshold of a patient’s/user’s problem.
